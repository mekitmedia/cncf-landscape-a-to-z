title: "Cruising through the 'C's: Cloud Native Storage and CI/CD"
date: 2026-02-01T09:00:00Z
draft: false
letter: "C"
---

We've officially entered the third phase of our A-to-Z journey! After an insightful look at the 'B' projects like Backstage and Buildpacks, we are now diving into one of the most content-rich letters in the entire landscape: **C**.

The letter 'C' is a powerhouse. It houses some of the most fundamental pillars of cloud native computing, including:

*   **Cloud Native Storage**: High-performance, distributed storage solutions that make stateful applications possible on Kubernetes.
*   **CI/CD**: The engines of modern software delivery—Argo, Flux, and Tekton all fall under this umbrella (under the 'A', 'F', and 'T' letters respectively, but often categorized together with 'Cloud Native' tools).
*   **Container Runtimes**: The core technology that allows us to run isolated applications.

### Featured Projects this Fortnight

Over the next two weeks, we'll be highlighting several key projects:

1.  **Cilium**: Revolutionizing networking, observability, and security with eBPF.
2.  **CloudEvents**: A specification for describing event data in common formats, providing interoperability across services.
3.  **Containerd**: An industry-standard container runtime used by Docker and Kubernetes.

Stay tuned as we release deep-dive tool pages for each of these over the next 14 days!
