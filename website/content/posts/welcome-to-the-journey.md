With over 1,000 tools, the CNCF Landscape can be overwhelming. It's easy to get lost in the sea of logos and categories. We believe it might be easier if you get to know the full Landscape over a year by looking at it one letter at a time.

From **A** to **Z**, that’s 26 letters. By dedicating two weeks to each letter, you will have explored the entire ecosystem in exactly one year (52 weeks).

### How it Works

To make this journey possible, we've built a sophisticated system behind the scenes:

*   **Deterministic ETL Pipeline**: Our automated pipeline extracts data directly from the official CNCF Landscape, transforms it, and organizes it by letter to ensure we never miss a project.
*   **Agentic AI Workflow**: For deeper insights, we use a team of specialized AI agents (Researchers, Writers, and Editors). They perform deep research on project features, use cases, and getting started guides, bringing you more than just a name and a link.

### What to Expect

Every two weeks, a new letter "unlocks," and we'll publish a summary post here featuring:
1.  **Hand-picked Highlights**: The most significant projects starting with that letter.
2.  **Detailed Research**: Deep dives into tools to help you understand their value immediately.
3.  **Weekly Discoveries**: Personal insights and trends we've noticed while exploring that part of the landscape.

Join us on this manageable, bite-sized journey to master the Cloud Native landscape, one letter at a time!
