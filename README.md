# CNCF Landscape A-to-Z

With over 1000 tools, CNCF Landscape can be hard to get your head around.

It might be easier if you'd get to know the full Landscape over a year by looking at it one letter at a time. A-to-Z thatâ€™s 26 letters. With one every two weeks, you should have seen all.

This repo contains a bot that parse the [landscape.yml](https://github.com/cncf/landscape/blob/master/landscape.yml) in the [cncf/landscape]() repository and sends recommendations every two weeks.
