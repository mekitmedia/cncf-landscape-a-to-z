## 2025-10-25 - Skip Link Implementation
**Learning:** Adding a "Skip to main content" link requires not just the link itself but ensuring the target `<main>` element has `tabindex="-1"` and a matching ID. This is critical for reliable focus management, especially in Single Page Applications or frameworks where the route might not refresh the page, but even in static sites it ensures the focus moves correctly for screen readers.
**Action:** When adding skip links, always verify the target container exists on *every* page template and has the correct ID and tabindex.
