    summary_business_use_case: Argo CD and Argo Rollouts - enabling a high frequency
      of deployment for quick delivery of new features and updates (constant iteration),
      decreasing mean time to recovery (MTTR) to recover quickly as if nothing had
      happened on production, decreasing lead time for changes and updates, to make
      sure that your clients stay satisfied and secure. Argo Workflows and Argo Events
      - creating scalable and manageable data pipelines, orchestrating highly parallel
      jobs without the overhead of legacy VMs or server environments, defining multiple
      dependencies from various event sources like webhooks, S3, schedules, streams,
      and triggering Kubernetes objects after successful event dependencies resolution.
