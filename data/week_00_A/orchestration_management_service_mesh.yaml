    summary_business_use_case: While service mesh becomes an important infrastructure
      for microservices, many(if not all) service mesh implementations mainly focus
      on HTTP protocols and treat other protocols as plain TCP traffic. This is an
      obstacle for a lot of organizations when they try to leverage service mesh's
      promised capablities to simplify their microservice development and operation.
      Aeraki Mesh solve this problem by providing a common layer-7 service mesh framework
      both in data plane and control plane, which is built on top of Envoy and Istio
      and can work with them together very well.
    summary_integrations: Istio, Envoy
    summary_personas: SREs, DevOps Engineers, Architects
    summary_release_rate: Every few months
    summary_tags: Service Mesh
    summary_use_case: Aeraki Mesh has been created to provide a non-intrusive, highly
      extendable way to manage any layer-7 traffic in a service mesh, including Dubbo,
      Thrift, bRPC, Redis, etc., and private protocols as well.
