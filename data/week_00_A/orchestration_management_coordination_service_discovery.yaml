  description: AWS Cloud Map is a cloud resource discovery service. With Cloud Map,
    you can define custom names for your application resources, and it maintains the
    updated location of these dynamically changing resources. This increases your
    application availability because your web service always discovers the most up-to-date
    locations of its resources.
