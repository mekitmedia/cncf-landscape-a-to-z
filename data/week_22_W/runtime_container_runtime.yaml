    summary_business_use_case: "WasmEdge improves cloud app\u2019s operational efficiency\
      \ by providing a secure, portable, fast, and lightweight alternative to traditional\
      \ Linux containers. It allows microservice or servelsss applications to \u201C\
      scale to zero\u201D \u2014 all computing resources can be made available on-demand,\
      \ and \u201Cwrite once run anywhere\u201D. It also works with existing container\
      \ management infra and programming languages, and hence minimizing the cost\
      \ of adoption and migration. It is great for running microservices and serverless\
      \ functions embedded in data pipelines or SaaS platforms."

    summary_use_case: 'WasmEdge provides a high-performance, lightweight, secure,
      and extensible WebAssembly runtime for cloud-native applications. It is an OCI
      compliant container that is integrated into Docker, containerd, crun and many
      Kubernetes projects.  Compared with traditional Linux container apps, WasmEdge
      apps are more secure, more portable, cold-start 100x faster and only take 1/10
      of the space.
