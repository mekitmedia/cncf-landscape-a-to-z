- description: Fortio is an open source load testing library, command-line tool, and
    server application written in Go. Originated as Istio's performance characterization
    tool (in particular proxy overhead), Fortio has evolved into a versatile tool
    for load testing and performance benchmarking of HTTP, gRPC, and TCP services.
    Among other options it enables users to generate a specified query-per-second
    (QPS) load and records detailed latency histograms, facilitating the analysis
    of performance metrics. The server component offers a straightforward web UI and
    REST API, allowing users to initiate tests and visualize results through graphical
    representations. Beyond load testing, Fortio provides server-side features akin
    to httpbin, including request echoing with headers, configurable latency or error
    responses, TCP echoing and proxying, HTTP fan-out, and support for gRPC echo and
    health checks. These capabilities make Fortio a versatile tool for debugging and
    testing high-performance services in cloud-native environments. As an organization
    set of git repositories, is also a growing set of reusable libraries for writing
    Cloud Native Go code and CLIs.
