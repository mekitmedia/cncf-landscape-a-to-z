  description: APIClarity is a cloud API observability open-source project that provides
    functionality to discover and monitor any API traffic that interacts with modern
    applications and report suspected security weaknesses or possible abuses. Once
    an OpenAPI spec is either uploaded or reconstructed by APIClarity, it monitors
    for shadow and zombie APIs, Broken Functional-Level Authorization (BFLA), Broken
    Object-Level Authorization (BOLA), weak authentication, sensitive data leaks and
    data injection risks.
