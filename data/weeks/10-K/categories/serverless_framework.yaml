  description: Auto scale-to-zero pods when idle and scale up pods when traffic arrives,
    without losing any requests. KubeElasti uses a smart proxy that queues incoming
    requests while scaling up targets, ensuring no request loss. It works with existing
    Kubernetes services and deployments without requiring code changes.
