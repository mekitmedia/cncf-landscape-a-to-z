    summary_business_use_case: Prevents many types of key and repository/registry
      compromises from impacting your users. Provides a secure way to recover from
      compromise. Twelve years of practical experience, about a dozen security audits,
      a half-dozen or so peer reviewed papers, a half-dozen or so implementations
      used in production, and millions of containers, etc. secured.
    summary_integrations: Docker, Amazon, Microsoft, Google Fuschia, Harbor, Toradex,
      Datadog, Sigstore, Automotive Grade Linux
    summary_intro_url: https://theupdateframework.io/
    summary_personas: Security teams, Repository administrators, Registry administrators
    summary_release_rate: The specification is quite stable.  Major spec versions
      update rarely, minor versions about annually, smaller releases (typo fixes /
      clarifications) happen as needed.
    summary_tags: Security, Go, Python, Rust, JavaScript, CLI
    summary_use_case: TUF secures container registries, package repositories, etc.
      so that the system resists successful attacks and can recover securely.  TUF
      uses a combination of security mechanisms and tooling to provide a strong root
      of trust used by other security projects as well, such as Sigstore.  It is easy
      to integrate and simple to manage; try it for yourself
