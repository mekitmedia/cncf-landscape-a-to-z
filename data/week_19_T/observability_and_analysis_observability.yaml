  description: Trink.io is the first log shipping platform, built to replace fragmented
    solutions and workarounds with a single solution that takes care of the basics
    while offering visibility and control that only a managed solution can. Trink
    handles the entire operational data collection scope for you, connecting to all
    of your sources (e.g AWS) and enabling you to choose your preferred destinations
    (Datadog, Logz, etc.) in minutes instead of days.
