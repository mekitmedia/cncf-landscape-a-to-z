    summary_business_use_case: TiKV provides a scalable, reliable, and easy-to-use
      storage engine for building distributed systems.  It helps organizations improve
      the performance, reliability, and availability of their systems.  TiKV helps
      organizations reduce risk by providing strong consistency. It helps ensure data
      integrity and accuracy.  TiKV helps organizations increase their responsiveness
      to customer demand by allowing them to scale their systems horizontally  as
      needed to handle increasing amounts of data and workload.
    summary_integration: TiKV provides both raw and ACID-compliant transactional key-value
      API, which is widely used in online serving services,  such as the metadata
      storage system for object storage service, the storage system for recommendation
      systems,  the online feature store, etc. TiKV is also widely used as the storage
      layer for database management systems, for example, TiDB, Zetta, Tidis, Titan,
      and JuiceFS. TiKV can also be deployed on Kubernetes via TiDB Operator and monitored
      by Prometheus.

    summary_use_case: TiKV excels at working with large-scale data by supporting petabyte-scale
      deployments spanning trillions of rows. It aims to solve the technical issue
      of scaling and reliably storing data in distributed systems that require  high
      performance and strong consistency. TiKV addresses the technical pain points
      of traditional databases by offering  horizontal scalability, strong consistency,
      high availability, and fault tolerance. It's particularly useful for  building
      real-time data processing apps.
