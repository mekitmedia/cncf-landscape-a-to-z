      compromises from impacting your users. Provides a secure way to recover from
      compromise. Twelve years of practical experience, about a dozen security audits,
      a half-dozen or so peer reviewed papers, a half-dozen or so implementations
      used in production, and millions of containers, etc. secured.

    summary_tags: Security, Go, Python, Rust, JavaScript, CLI
    summary_use_case: TUF secures container registries, package repositories, etc.
      so that the system resists successful attacks and can recover securely.  TUF
      uses a combination of security mechanisms and tooling to provide a strong root
      of trust used by other security projects as well, such as Sigstore.  It is easy
      to integrate and simple to manage; try it for yourself

    summary_business_use_case: TiKV provides a scalable, reliable, and easy-to-use
      storage engine for building distributed systems.  It helps organizations improve
      the performance, reliability, and availability of their systems.  TiKV helps
      organizations reduce risk by providing strong consistency. It helps ensure data
      integrity and accuracy.  TiKV helps organizations increase their responsiveness
      to customer demand by allowing them to scale their systems horizontally  as
      needed to handle increasing amounts of data and workload.
    summary_integration: TiKV provides both raw and ACID-compliant transactional key-value
      API, which is widely used in online serving services,  such as the metadata
      storage system for object storage service, the storage system for recommendation
      systems,  the online feature store, etc. TiKV is also widely used as the storage
      layer for database management systems, for example, TiDB, Zetta, Tidis, Titan,
      and JuiceFS. TiKV can also be deployed on Kubernetes via TiDB Operator and monitored
      by Prometheus.

      Platform Engineers, DBA
    summary_release_rate: Per month
    summary_tags: Key-value database,Cloud storage,Transactional,TiDB,Strong consistency,Raft,RocksDB,Titan,Raft-Engine
    summary_use_case: TiKV excels at working with large-scale data by supporting petabyte-scale
      deployments spanning trillions of rows. It aims to solve the technical issue
      of scaling and reliably storing data in distributed systems that require  high
      performance and strong consistency. TiKV addresses the technical pain points
      of traditional databases by offering  horizontal scalability, strong consistency,
      high availability, and fault tolerance. It's particularly useful for  building
      real-time data processing apps.
