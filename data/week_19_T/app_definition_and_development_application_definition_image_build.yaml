    summary_business_use_case: Telepresence speeds up development teams by allowing
      them to instantly test changes in dev or staging environments without having
      to wait for their changes to be built into a container and deployed. It also
      saves money by enabling developers to share cloud environments to do integration
      testing.

    summary_use_case: Telepresence is a local-to-remote kubernetes debugging tool
      that creates a two-way proxy from your laptop to the cluster. You can access
      cluster resources as if they were local and intercept traffic to one or more
      services to develop in an integrated environment without the need for a container
      build-push-deploy loop.
