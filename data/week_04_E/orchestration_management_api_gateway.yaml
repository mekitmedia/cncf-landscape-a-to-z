    summary_business_use_case: Emissary-Ingress speeds up deployment time and reduces
      the burden on platform teams by empowering developers to deploy new routes in
      a self-service manner. Platform/cloud teams can centrally manage hosts and certificates
      while developers can manage the resources relevant to them.

    summary_use_case: Emissary-Ingress is a k8s-native, Envoy-based API gateway. It
      is designed to allow teams to work in a more decentralized way than the traditional
      Ingress object. Emissary-Ingress can scan for its CRDs across all namespaces,
      so development teams can deploy new network routing rules along with the apps
      that use them, increasing velocity. Emissary-Ingress can be extended via API
      calls with authentication and rate limiting services. It is compatible with
      all the CNCF service meshes, and facilitates canary deployments when integrated
      with Argo Rollouts.
