    summary_business_use_case: 'You can think about Falco as a security camera for
      containers, Kubernetes and the cloud: it collects signals from hosts, containers,
      orchestrators and cloud logs, and it reports suspicious or anomalous behavior.
      Falco provides kernel instrumentation mechanisms to detect security events.
      It then enriches them with metadata pulled from the node, the container runtime
      and Kubernetes. This metadata is then used to dynamically apply Falco rules
      based on the container name, image, orchestrator labels, orchestrator resource
      type, etc.'
    summary_integrations: Kubernetes Audit Logs, AWS Cloudtrail, GitHub Audit Events,
      and the 40+ outputs supported by Falcosidekick (e.g. Slack, AWS Lambda, etc)
    summary_personas: SREs, Cloud Architects, Platform Engineers, DevOps Engineer,
      DevOps practitioners, DevSecOps practitioners
    summary_release_rate: 3 times per year (end of Jan, June, Sept)
    summary_tags: Security, Go, C++, DevOps, DevSecOps, Container, Cloud native, Kubernetes,
      Runtime, Threat detection, Syscalls, Monitoring, Observability, Anomaly detection,
      Kubernetes
    summary_use_case: Falco is a cloud-native runtime security project that makes
      it easy to consume kernel events. Falco enriches these events with additional
      information from the Kubernetes platform and ecosystem as well as the rest of
      the cloud native stack. Falco can also be extended to other data sources through
      the use of plugins. Falco offers a rich set of security rules designed for Kubernetes,
      Linux, and cloud native environments. When a rule is violated in the system,
      Falco alerts users with details about the violation and severity.
