    summary_business_use_case: 'You can think about Falco as a security camera for
      containers, Kubernetes and the cloud: it collects signals from hosts, containers,
      orchestrators and cloud logs, and it reports suspicious or anomalous behavior.
      Falco provides kernel instrumentation mechanisms to detect security events.
      It then enriches them with metadata pulled from the node, the container runtime
      and Kubernetes. This metadata is then used to dynamically apply Falco rules
      based on the container name, image, orchestrator labels, orchestrator resource
      type, etc.'
    summary_integrations: Kubernetes Audit Logs, AWS Cloudtrail, GitHub Audit Events,
      and the 40+ outputs supported by Falcosidekick (e.g. Slack, AWS Lambda, etc)
    summary_personas: SREs, Cloud Architects, Platform Engineers, DevOps Engineer,
      DevOps practitioners, DevSecOps practitioners
    summary_release_rate: 3 times per year (end of Jan, June, Sept)

      Runtime, Threat detection, Syscalls, Monitoring, Observability, Anomaly detection,
      Kubernetes
    summary_use_case: Falco is a cloud-native runtime security project that makes
      it easy to consume kernel events. Falco enriches these events with additional
      information from the Kubernetes platform and ecosystem as well as the rest of
      the cloud native stack. Falco can also be extended to other data sources through
      the use of plugins. Falco offers a rich set of security rules designed for Kubernetes,
      Linux, and cloud native environments. When a rule is violated in the system,
      Falco alerts users with details about the violation and severity.

    summary_business_use_case: GitOps is the natural evolution of configuration as
      code. Businesses moving to Flux can deal with infrastructure at scale more easily,
      and allow their developers to focus on code, not on deployment problems. With
      its vast ecosystem of Flux integrations and being integrated into cloud offerings
      everywhere, adopting Flux can be adopted in virtually every setup.
    summary_integrations: all standard Cloud Native, Git provider and observability
      tooling
    summary_personas: SREs, DevOps & Platform Engineers, Architects, Developers
    summary_release_rate: Minor releases have a cadence of at least one per month.

    summary_use_case: Flux is a tool for keeping Kubernetes clusters in sync with
      sources of configuration (like Git repositories and OCI artifacts), and automating
      updates to configuration when there is new code to deploy. Flux is built from
      the ground up to use Kubernetes' API extension system, and to integrate with
      Prometheus and other core components of the Kubernetes ecosystem. Flux supports
      multi-tenancy and support for syncing an arbitrary number of Git repositories,
      among other long-requested features.

  description: Fortio is an open source load testing library, command-line tool, and
    server application written in Go. Originated as Istio's performance characterization
    tool (in particular proxy overhead), Fortio has evolved into a versatile tool
    for load testing and performance benchmarking of HTTP, gRPC, and TCP services.
    Among other options it enables users to generate a specified query-per-second
    (QPS) load and records detailed latency histograms, facilitating the analysis
    of performance metrics. The server component offers a straightforward web UI and
    REST API, allowing users to initiate tests and visualize results through graphical
    representations. Beyond load testing, Fortio provides server-side features akin
    to httpbin, including request echoing with headers, configurable latency or error
    responses, TCP echoing and proxying, HTTP fan-out, and support for gRPC echo and
    health checks. These capabilities make Fortio a versatile tool for debugging and
    testing high-performance services in cloud-native environments. As an organization
    set of git repositories, is also a growing set of reusable libraries for writing
    Cloud Native Go code and CLIs.
