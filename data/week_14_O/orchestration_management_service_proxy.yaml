    summary_tags: OpenELB, LoadBalancer, Kubernetes
    summary_use_case: In cloud-based Kubernetes clusters, Services are usually exposed
      by using load balancers provided by cloud vendors. However, cloud-based load
      balancers are unavailable in bare-metal environments. OpenELB allows users to
      create LoadBalancer Services in bare-metal, edge, and virtualization environments
      for external access, and provides the same user experience as cloud-based load
      balancers.
