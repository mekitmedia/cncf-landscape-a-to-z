    summary_business_use_case: OpenFunction is a cloud-native open source FaaS (Function
      as a Service) platform aiming to let users focus on their business logic without
      having to  maintain the underlying runtime environment and infrastructure. Users
      can generate event-driven and dynamically scaling Serverless workloads by simply  submitting
      business-related source code in the form of functions. Users can also build
      and run serverless applications as well.
    summary_integration: Knative, Dapr, KEDA, Shipwright, Kubernetes Gateway API,
      Contour
    summary_intro_url: https://openfunction.dev/docs/
    summary_personas: Developers, Platform engineers
    summary_release_rate: 3 ~ 4 major releases per year
    summary_tags: FaaS, Serverless, KEDA, Knative, Shipwright, Buildpacks, Distributed
      Systems
    summary_use_case: Users can use OpenFunction in several different ways including
      building functions or applications only, running sync or async serverless functions
      or applications, building and then running serverless functions or applications,
      building and then running serverless wasm applications(In progress).  In all
      use cases, users can utilize Dapr to communicate with various backend services
