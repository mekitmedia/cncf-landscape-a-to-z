    summary_business_use_case: Application authorization is often implemented differently
      across a company's applications and hard-coded in application code, making it
      challenging to evolve and comprehend. This difficulty leads to poorly implemented
      authorization, a top security risk identified by OWASP. OpenFGA provides a flexible,
      centralized, and scalable authorization system to address this issue.

    summary_personas: Platform Engineers, Security Engineers, Developers, Architects
    summary_release_rate: Twice per month
    summary_tags: Security, Authorization, Scalability, Cloud-Native, Developers
    summary_use_case: OpenFGA enables developers to implement highly performant and
      flexible authorization for their applications. It incorporates Relationship-Based
      Access Control (ReBAC) and Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) concepts with
      a domain-specific language that simplifies crafting authorization and permission
      solutions, scalable to any use case and scale

    validation, and governance of documentation artifacts for compliance needs. It
    leverages NIST's OSCAL (Open Security Controls Assessment Language) as a standard
    data format for interchange between tools and people, and provides an opinionated
    approach to OSCAL SDK and adoption by policy engines.
