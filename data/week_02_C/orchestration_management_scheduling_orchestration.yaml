    summary_business_use_case: Within a singular cluster, the Capsule Controller seamlessly
      consolidates multiple namespaces into an efficient construct known as a "Tenant".
      This tenant acts as a unified group of Kubernetes Namespaces. Inside each tenant,
      users possess the autonomy to establish their own namespaces and utilize the
      entirety of designated resources. This design facilitates the creation of a
      multi-tenant ecosystem within a single Kubernetes cluster.  Not only can tenants
      be distinctly separated for enhanced operational management, but it also ensures
      the cluster remains singular, streamlining  maintenance processes. The end result?
      Heightened operational efficiency for administrators and significant cost savings
      for the business.

  description: Crossplane is the cloud native control plane framework that allows
    you to build control planes without needing to write code. Crossplane has a highly
    extensible backend that enables you to orchestrate applications and infrastructure
    no matter where they run and a highly configurable frontend that lets you define
    the declarative API it offers.

      \ platform. The cloud vendors have been building with control planes for years.\
      \ Now Crossplane helps you do the same. Control planes are self-healing\u2014\
      they automatically correct drift. Consumers can self-service fast because control\
      \ planes offer a single point of control for policy and permissions, and control\
      \ planes integrate easily with other systems because they expose an API, not\
      \ just a command-line."
