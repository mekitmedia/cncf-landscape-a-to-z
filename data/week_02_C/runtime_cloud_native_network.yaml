    summary_business_use_case: Cilium reduces the operational complexity and cost
      of running highly scalable and dynamic cloud native environments. By leveraging
      eBPF, Cilium accelerates and simplifies service connectivity, makes systems
      observable for easier monitoring and debugging, and provides deep security observability
      and runtime enforcement.
    summary_integration: Kubernetes, Prometheus, OpenTelemetry, Envoy, Istio, Grafana,
      cert-manager, SPIFFE
    summary_personas: Platform engineers, Network teams, SRE, DevOps Engineers, Security
      teams
    summary_release_rate: 2-3 major releases a year, plus minor and point releases
      for bug fixes and security updates
    summary_tags: CNI, Networking, Load Balancing, Service Mesh, Observability, Runtime
      Security, eBPF, Cluster Mesh, Multicloud
    summary_use_case: 'Cilium is a networking, observability, and security platform
      based on eBPF. As a CNI, it provides a flat Layer 3 network, even across clusters.
      Cilium enforces network policies on L3-L7 using an identity based security model.


      Cilium implements distributed load balancing between pods and to external services
      by replacing kube-proxy. It also has advanced functionality like ingress and
      egress gateway, bandwidth management, service mesh, and deep network and security
      observability through Hubble and Tetragon.'
