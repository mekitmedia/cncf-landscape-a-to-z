    summary_business_use_case: Causely reduces downtime and speeds up incident resolution
      by identifying causal links across infrastructure. This improves developer velocity,
      lowers operational risk, and reduces the cost of poor performance or failure
      in production systems.

      Helm, Grafana, Datadog, Elastic Search, Kafka

    summary_personas: SREs, Engineers, Platform Engineers, DevOps Engineers, DevOps
      practitioners
    summary_tags: observability, causal reasoning, root cause analysis
    summary_use_case: Causely helps engineering teams pinpoint root causes of software
      regressions across services and deployments using eBPF and OpenTelemetry. It
      detects causality, not just correlation, making it possible to ship code fearlessly
      and recover faster from production issues.
