  description: Cedar is an open source authorization policy language that enables
    developers to express fine-grained permissions as easy-to-understand policies
    enforced in their applications, and decouple access control from application logic.
    Cedar is designed to be ergonomic, fast, safe, and analyzable using automated
    reasoning. Cedar's simple and intuitive syntax supports common authorization use-cases
    with readable policies, naturally expressing concepts from role-based, attribute-based,
    and relation-based access control models. Cedar's policy structure enables authorization
    requests to be decided quickly. Its policy validator uses optional typing to help
    policy writers avoid mistakes, but not get in their way. Cedar's design has been
    finely balanced to allow for a sound, complete, and decidable logical encoding,
    which enables precise automated analysis of Cedar policies, e.g., to ensure that
    policy refactoring preserves existing permissions. Cedar's language specification
    has been formally verified using a theorem prover to satisfy key security properties
    like "deny trumps allow," and its implementation in Rust undergoes rigorous differential
    random testing against its formal specification. By combining mathematical rigor
    with developer-friendly design, Cedar offers a practical approach to secure, maintainable
    authorization for modern applications.
