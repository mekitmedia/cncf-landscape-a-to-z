    summary_business_use_case: 'CRI-O  is able to tune its behavior to that of the
      Kubelet, enabling features and performance gains through customization. It is
      tested against a suite of thousands of tests, including the suite of Kubernetes
      e2e tests, to ensure compatibility with Kubernetes workloads. It has long had
      security on the forefront of its design philosophy, enabling new security knobs
      and reducing the attack surface for the purposes of running containers in production.
