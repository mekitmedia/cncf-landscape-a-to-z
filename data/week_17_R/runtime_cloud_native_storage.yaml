    summary_business_use_case: " Rook provides a consistent storage platform, whether\
      \ in the cloud or on bare metal. The storage cluster is managed through Kubernetes\
      \ Custom Resources, making integrating with your existing DevOps/ GitOps toolset\
      \ easy.\n For your applications to consume storage, they simply need to use\
      \ the Kubernetes native approach of creating a `PersistentVolumeClaim`.\n Running\
      \ a Rook Ceph cluster is made accessible due to the operator pattern.\n The\
      \ operator pattern allows the Rook project to handle most tasks automatically\
      \ (e.g., updating to a new Ceph version). These automatic processes reduce the\
      \ time spent setting up, configuring, maintaining, and updating your Rook storage\
      \ cluster."
    summary_integration: CSI (Container Storage Interface) Integration, Helm Chart,
      Prometheus
    summary_personas: SRE/ DevOps Engineers
    summary_release_rate: 'Minor releases: approximately three times a year (similar
      to Kubernetes cadence), Patch releases: bi-weekly'

    summary_use_case: " Rook is an open source cloud-native storage orchestrator,\
      \ providing the platform, framework, and support for Ceph storage to integrate\
      \ with cloud-native environments natively.\n Ceph is a distributed storage system\
      \ that provides block, file, and object storage and is deployed in large-scale\
      \ production clusters.\n Rook automates deployment and management of Ceph to\
      \ provide self-managing, self-scaling, and self-healing storage services. The\
      \ Rook operator builds on Kubernetes resources to deploy, configure, provision,\
      \ scale, upgrade, and monitor Ceph.\n The storage cluster can be run hyper-converged\
      \ beside your applications, in a cloud, or on bare metal. Rook provides a consistent\
      \ storage platform anywhere Kubernetes runs."
