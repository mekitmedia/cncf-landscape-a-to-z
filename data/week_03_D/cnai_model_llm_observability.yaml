  description: DeepFlow leverages eBPF to collect signals such as performance metrics,
    distributed tracing, and CPU & GPU profiling. Its goal is to provide zero-code
    observability for complex cloud-native and AI applications, particularly those
    involving LLM training and inference using frameworks like PyTorch.
