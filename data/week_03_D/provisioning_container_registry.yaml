    summary_business_use_case: Reduce back-to-source download traffic and back-to-source
      requests, improve node idle bandwidth utilization. Solve the problem of insufficient
      bandwidth or overload to download resources when accessing centralized container
      registry or file service in large-scale Kubernetes cluster. Based on P2P technology,
      reduce the bandwidth and load of container registry or file service, and accelerate
      the download speed of images or files.
