    summary_personas: Kubernetes users who need persistent storage in their cluster.
    summary_release_rate: 1.0 GA released on May 2020. Latest v1.4.0 was released

    summary_use_case: "* Highly available persistent storage for Kubernetes\nIn the\
      \ past, ITOps and DevOps have found it hard to add replicated storage to Kubernetes\
      \ clusters. As a result many non-cloud-hosted Kubernetes clusters don\u2019\
      t support persistent storage. External storage arrays are non-portable and can\
      \ be extremely expensive.\nLonghorn delivers simplified, easy to deploy and\
      \ upgrade, 100% open source, cloud-native persistent block storage without the\
      \ cost overhead of open core or proprietary alternatives.\n* Easy incremental\
      \ snapshots and backups\nLonghorn\u2019s built-in incremental snapshot and backup\
      \ features keep the volume data safe in or out of the Kubernetes cluster.\n\
      Scheduled backups of persistent storage volumes in Kubernetes clusters is simplified\
      \ with Longhorn\u2019s intuitive, free management UI.\n* Cross-cluster disaster\
      \ recovery\nExternal replication solutions will recover from a disk failure\
      \ by re-replicating the entire data store. This can take days, during which\
      \ time the cluster performs poorly and has a higher risk of failure.\nUsing\
      \ Longhorn, you can control the granularity to the maximum, easily create a\
      \ disaster recovery volume in another Kubernetes cluster, and failover to it\
      \ in the event of an emergency.\nIf your main cluster fails, you can bring up\
      \ the app in the DR cluster quickly with a defined RPO and RTO."
