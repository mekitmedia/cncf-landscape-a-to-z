    summary_business_use_case: Kairos can be utilized by businesses to deploy secure,
      consistent, and easily managed edge computing platforms across multiple locations.
      For instance, a retail chain can transform its in-store Linux systems into customized,
      secure, and uniform environments. This setup ensures seamless deployment and
      management of applications, enhances data security through immutable images
      and encryption, and reduces maintenance overhead. The system's compatibility
      with Kubernetes and ease of installation make it an optimal choice for scalable
      and automated edge computing solutions.

    summary_use_case: 'Kratix is a framework for building composable internal developer
      platforms (IDPs).  Kratix enables platform teams to offer everything(X)-as-a-service
      to enable developers to ship code faster, safer, and at scale.

      The three core components of Kratix are Promises, Workflows, and Fleet Management.                  A
      Kratix Promise is an API contract between the Platform and its users. Kratix
      Workflows define reusable actions (and "aspects") that hook into the Promise
      lifecycle.  Kratix implements fleet management using GitOps principles to continually
      reconcile desired cluster and platform states.

      Kratix acts as a platform orchestrator, integrating and acting as the glue between
      app management UX (portals, APIs, CLI) and infrastructure as code (IaC). In
      addition to providing the ability to create platform/service APIs via Promises,
      Kratix also manages the lifecycle of the platform itself, supporting day 1,
      day 2, and day 2000 operations.

    summary_business_use_case: 'KubeEdge has found widespread adoption across multiple
      industries, including transportation, energy, internet, CDN, manufacturing,
      and smart campuses. Some of the notable use cases include:

      Tiansuan Constellation Program: KubeEdge has been integrated into the cloud-native
      satellite computing platform initiated by the Shenzhen Institute of Beijing
      University of Posts and Telecommunications (BUPT) with Spacety Co., Ltd. KubeEdge
      brings in orbit-earth collaboration for the Tiansuan-1 Satellite in the platform,
      this integration has enabled new service scenarios such as image inference,
      incremental deep learning, and federated learning.

      China''s highway electronic toll collection (ETC) system: KubeEdge has been
      instrumental in managing nearly 100,000 edge nodes and over 500,000 edge applications
      in 29 of China''s 34 provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions. With
      these applications, the system processes more than 300 million data records
      daily and supports continuous updates of ETC services on highways. As a result,
      the time taken to pass through toll stations has been reduced from 29s to 3s
      for trucks, and from 15s to 2s for cars.

      Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao bridge: KubeEdge manages edge nodes deployed on the world''s
      longest sea crossing bridge, which collects up to 14 different types of sensor
      data, including light intensity, carbon dioxide, atmospheric pressure, noise,
      temperature, humidity, PM 2.5, PM 10, rain and snow, acceleration, angular velocity,
      Euler angle, magnetic field, and sound. It also enables business apps and device
      mapper and AI interference programs to be deployed at the edge.

      SAIC MAXUS MIFA 9: The next-generation car-cloud collaborative architecture,
      SAIC MAXUS full-size luxury, smart, pure electric MPV MIFA 9, has become the
      first-ever vehicle with KubeEdge Inside. This platform can manage 100,000+ nodes
      and millions of edge devices and is based on KubeEdge''s capabilities such as
      lightweight architecture, optimized for unstable cloud-edge networks at scale,
      simplified heterogeneous IoT device management, and edge autonomy in the case
      of disconnection.

      CDN platform of China Telecom: KubeEdge is used to manage CDN edge nodes, automatically
      deploy and upgrade CDN edge services, and implement edge service disaster recovery
      (DR) when migrating CDN services to the cloud.

      China Mobile On-line Marketing Service Center: The largest call center in the
      world, with 44,000 agents, 900 million users, and 53 customer service centers,
      builds a cloud-edge synergy architecture consisting of two centers and multiple
      edges based on KubeEdge.

      Xinghai IoT: This IoT company provides comprehensive smart building solutions
      by leveraging a construction IoT platform, intelligent hardware, and AI. Xinghai
      IoT built a smart campus with cloud-edge-device synergy based on KubeEdge and
      its own Xinghai IoT cloud platform, greatly improving the efficiency of campus
      management. With AI assistance, nearly 30% of the repetitive work is automated.

      SF Express: The largest integrated logistics service provider in China and the
      fourth largest in the world, completely transformed their supply chains by implementing
      KubeEdge. The smart supply chain system enables edge-cloud synergy, edge data
      collection, real-time edge data processing, massive IoT device management, and
      creates a more stable, secure, and reliable edge industrial IoT system.
