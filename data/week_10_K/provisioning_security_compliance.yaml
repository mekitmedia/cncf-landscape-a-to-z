    summary_business_use_case: 'Keycloak provides built-in cloud-native identity and
      access control standards. By delegating the security aspects of an application
      to Keycloak,  developers don''t need to worry about different authentication
      mechanisms, understand about cryptography, or how to safely store passwords.

      Developers can take advantage of modern authentication and authorization protocols
      like OAuth2, OpenID Connect, WebAuthn, SAML2 based IDPs, LDAP servers, Kerberos/SPNEGO.

      Keycloak enables infrastructure teams and cloud-native developers to secure
      their cloud-native stack technologies through consolidated security standards,
      to provide to users a cloud-friendly experience with a strong focus on usability,
      scalability, and security.'

      custom user storage solutions

    summary_use_case: 'Keycloak is an Open-Source Identity and Access Management Solution
      for Modern Applications and Services. The project is primarily designed to make
      it easy  for developers to secure their applications with minimal effort.

      Keycloak builds on top of industry security standard protocols supporting OAuth2,
      OpenID Connect, WebAuthn. It also empowers administrators and users,  providing
      an extensive and friendly interface to configure and manage Keycloak. Existing
      security infrastructure like SAML2 based IdPs, LDAP servers,  Kerberos/SPNEGO,
      custom user storage solutions are easy to integrate while making their presence
      transparent to applications and end users.

      Keycloak provides fully customizable login pages, strong authentication, support
      for password recovery, client secret rotation, recovery codes for 2FA,  terms
      and conditions, step-up authentication, and a lot more. All of this without
      any need for coding at all. All pages visible to users support custom themes,
      making  it easy to modify the look and feel of the pages to integrate with your
      corporate branding and existing applications.'

      solutions. Thanks to policies being WebAssembly, Kubewarden policies can leverage
      and reuse upstream libraries to expand on current policy solutions while keeping
      compatibility (e.g: its cel-policy uses Kubernetes'' cel-go interpreter, its
      kyverno-policy compiles a subset of Kyverno codebase to support Kyverno''s YAML-like
      DSL).  Kubewarden policy CRDs and PolicyServer CRD enable insulation of consumers
