    summary_business_use_case: Engineering teams want to have flexibility and choose
      the best tool for their needs, creating complex pipelines that are hard to control
      and maintain. Using Keptn, teams can focus on the application code and forget
      about Deployment complexity and tool integration. Similarly, SREs can enforce
      their SLOs/SLAs at the application and microservice levels.
    summary_integrations: Any containerized application, OpenTelemetry, Prometheus
    summary_personas: SREs, DevOps & Platform Engineers, Architects, Developers
    summary_tags: Application, Container, Microservices, Security, GitOps, Kubernetes,
      Helm, Observability, CI/CD, SLI, SLO, SLA, Observability
    summary_use_case: 'Keptn supports teams that build their next generation platform
      on Kubernetes by solving the following 3 major challenges:

      1: Tame observability tool complexity: Keptn unifies access to ALL observability
      data through a single metrics server

      2: Remove complex delivery pipeline logic: Keptn provides deployment lifecycle
      tasks natively in Kubernetes

      3: Root cause for deploy change impact: Keptn emits end-2-end telemetry data
      to understand and troubleshoot deployments'
