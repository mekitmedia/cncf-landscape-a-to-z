    summary_business_use_case: "Create and implement any software system securely,\
      \ privately and at record speed - and save\n                costs on infrastructure\
      \ and operations through automated optimization. You do the special sauce -\n\
      \                Kapeta does the rest.\n                And once your done -\
      \ explain the system to non-technical people easily through the visual system\

    summary_use_case: "Kapeta will automate and accelerate your entire software development\
      \ lifecycle. This is made\n                possible by defining your software\
      \ components as lego-like building blocks, and then using these\n          \
      \      building blocks to define your software system. Kapeta then knows all\
      \ it needs to know to generate code,\n                devcontainers, and eventually\
      \ deploy. Think of it as an internal developer platform (iDP) on steroids."
