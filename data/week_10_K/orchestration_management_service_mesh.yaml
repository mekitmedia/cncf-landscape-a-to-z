  description: Kmesh is a high-performance and low overhead service mesh data plane
    based on eBPF and programmable kernel. Kmesh brings traffic management, security
    and monitoring to service communication without needing application code changes.
    It is natively sidecarless, zero intrusion and without adding any resource cost
    to application container.

    summary_business_use_case: It is becoming more important then ever to ensure that
      traffic is secure, observable, and reliable. Kuma service mesh enables users
      to adopt a zero trust application networking model while providing flexible
      traffic management and observability capabilities.  Kuma also supports a wide
      variety of platforms including Kubernetes, Nomad, Docker, and Virtual Machines.
      Thereby allowing organizations to take advantage of these benefits even at the
      start of their digital transformation journey.
