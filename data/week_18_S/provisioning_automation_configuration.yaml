  description: SDC (schema Driven Configuration) exposes any schema based configuration
    as Kubernetes resources.
  extra:
    summary_integrations: Kubernetes
    summary_personas: Network Engineers, SREs
    summary_tags: GitOps, Network Management, Automation, Netconf, YANG
    summary_use_case: The paradigm of schema-driven API approaches is gaining increasing
      popularity as it facilitates programmatic interaction with systems by both machines
      and humans. While OpenAPI schema stands out as a widely embraced system, there
      are other notable schema approaches like YANG, among others. This project endeavors
      to empower users with a declarative and idempotent method for seamless interaction
      with API systems, providing a robust foundation for effective system configuration.
