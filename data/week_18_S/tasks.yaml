    summary_use_case: The paradigm of schema-driven API approaches is gaining increasing
      popularity as it facilitates programmatic interaction with systems by both machines
      and humans. While OpenAPI schema stands out as a widely embraced system, there
      are other notable schema approaches like YANG, among others. This project endeavors
      to empower users with a declarative and idempotent method for seamless interaction
      with API systems, providing a robust foundation for effective system configuration.

    summary_business_use_case: 'In today''s business environment, rapidly delivering
      innovative customer experiences through differentiated applications and services
      is necessary for competitive advantage. As a result, organizations witness a
      change in how applications and services are being architected, built, and deployed.
      New technologies such as cloud and containers help organizations release faster,
      at scale. Services need to be built at high velocity and deployed on a vast
      plethora of platforms. As development accelerates, these systems are becoming
      increasingly interdependent and interconnected to deliver a consistent customer
      experience.


      Organizations may be inhibited in achieving high velocity and gaining market
      share or mission assurance for such major reasons as compliance, the pool of
      expertise, and interoperability challenges between teams/organizations and within
      existing solutions.


      For business leaders focused on improving business expediency and returns, SPIFFE
      can significantly reduce costs associated with the overhead of managing and
      issuing cryptographic identity documents (e.g. X.509 certificates), and accelerate
      development and deployment by removing the need for developers to understand
      the identity and authentication technologies required to secure service-to-service
      communication.


      Technology integration as a result of organizational convergence can be a challenge
      when different technology stacks must come together and interoperate. Aligning
      on a common, industry-accepted standard for system-to-system communication with
      identity and authentication, simplifies the technical aspects of full interoperability
      and integration across multiple stacks.


      SPIFFE brings a shared understanding of what constitutes software identity.
      By further leveraging SPIFFE Federation, components in disparate systems in
      different organizations or teams can establish trust to communicate securely
      without the added overhead of constructs such as VPN tunnels, one-o certificates,
      or shared credentials for use between such systems.

    summary_use_case: 'The Secure Production Identity Framework For Everyone (SPIFFE)
      Project defines a framework and set of standards for identifying and securing
      communications between application services. At its core, SPIFFE is:


      A standard defining how services identify themselves to each other. These are
      called SPIFFE IDs and are implemented as Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs).


      A standard for encoding SPIFFE IDs in a cryptographically-verifiable document
      called a SPIFFE Verifiable Identity Document or SVIDs.


      An API specification for issuing and/or retrieving SVIDs. This is the Workload
      API.


      The SPIFFE Project has a reference implementation, the SPIRE (the SPIFFE Runtime
      Environment), that in addition to the above, it:


      - Performs node and workload attestation.


      - Implements a signing framework for securely issuing and renewing SVIDs.


      - Provides an API for registering nodes and workloads, along with their designated
      SPIFFE IDs.


      - Provides and manages the rotation of keys and certs for mutual authentication
      and encryption between workloads.


      - Simplifies access from identified services to secret stores, databases, services
      meshes and cloud provider services.


      - Interoperability and federation to SPIFFE compatible systems across heterogeneous
      environments and administrative trust boundaries


      The SPIFFE Workload API can attest running software systems and issue SPIFFE
      IDs and SVIDs to them. This in turn allows two workloads to establish trust
      between each other, for example by establishing an mTLS connection or by signing
      and verifying a JWT token. Use of SPIFFE can also enable workloads to securely
      authenticate to a secret store, a database, or a cloud provider service.
